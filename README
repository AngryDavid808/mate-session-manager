This is a fork of the session manager for MATE Session Manager, with the ability to add a wav sound (name it "mate-logout.wav") to play before rebooting or shutting down by utilizing aplay (primary) and/or paplay (backup).
Simply place your .wav file in "/usr/share/sounds/" and the sound will play upon rebooting or shutting down before continuing the process. If none found,
operation continues normally.
=============

Known issues
=============
- There's a delay before the sound plays and after it finishes by 500ms by design (which is necessary for now to avoid cutting off
  or continuing to reboot or shut down too early). This is due to the way that MATE handles both operations.
- The implementation merely depends on manually placing a specific file in a specific directory due to lack of UI implementation of the feature.
  Other file types will simply not work because the program will not find it, it has to be a .wav file.
- You tell me! Don't forget to support the MATE team as well!
